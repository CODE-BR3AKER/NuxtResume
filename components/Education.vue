          Established in 1636, Harvard is the oldest higher education
          institution in the United States, and is widely regarded in terms of
          its influence, reputation, and academic pedigree as a leading
          university in not just the US but also the world.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I
          have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight
          deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a
          lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the
          <em>Harvard Mountaineering Club</em> taking on roles such as
          <em>Trip Secretary</em> and <em>Vice-President</em>.
