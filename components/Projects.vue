          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't
          agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it
          has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills
          through this and been I’m very proud of having this in my portfolio.
          If you don’t have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make
          one.
